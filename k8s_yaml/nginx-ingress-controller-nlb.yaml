  # --- PERFORMANCE & SOURCE IP PRESERVATION ---
  # CRITICAL: Preserves the original client source IP. Also required for L4 Load

  # --- ENTERPRISE SECURITY (Firewall Restriction) ---
  # CRITICAL: Restricts the NLB's external access by programming a firewall rule
  # on the GCP forwarding rule to ONLY allow traffic from these CIDR blocks.
